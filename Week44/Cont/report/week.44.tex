Note to  Exercises.fs
\section*{11.1}
\subsection*{11.1(ii)}
Calling the continuation based \emph{lenc xs : int list k : int -> int : int}
function with a function \emph{f = (fun x -> 2*x)} will return twice the list
length, as the first given continuation is the last to be executed. (otherwise
it would have returned \emph{length + f (0 * 2)}, i.e. the list's length.

\subsection*{11.1(iii)}
\emph{lenc} and \emph{leni} are essentially the same funtion. \emph{lenc}
represents the accumulating parameter of \emph{leni} by a chain of functions,
build and passed on in each recursive call. There exists a general
transformation from iterative functions (such as \emph{len} and \emph{leni}) to
an equivalent continuation based function.

\section*{11.2}
\subsection*{11.2(ii)}
Calling \emph{revc} with \emph{fun v -> v@v} you get the reversed list appended
on the reversed list. E.g. \emph{revc [1;2;3] (fun v -> v@ v)} returns
\emph{[3;2;1;3;2;1]}.

\section*{11.8}
\subsection*{11.8(iv)}
We are not certain our \emph{multiples} implementation is satisfying.
Applying \emph{Every} on \emph{multiples} runs forever, but
\emph{And(FromTo(1,3), multiples(3))} will only return 3, not 3, 6, 9.
Comments and suggestive nods are welcome :)
